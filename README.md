# Dynamic User List with Handlebars

This project displays a dynamic list of users using **Handlebars.js**, styled with **Tailwind CSS** and **DaisyUI**.  
User data is loaded from a JSON file and rendered into cards using Handlebars partials and conditional logic.  
Admin users are automatically highlighted, and the layout is fully responsive with hover effects for better user experience.
